# SocialNetworkAPI
This project was to create an API from scratch for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts and create a friend list. For this application, a MongoDB database was used along with the Mongoose ODM. 
Insomnia was used to test all of the API routes.
